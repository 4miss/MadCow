1.When compiling, MadCow needs to be in a short path folder, otherwise command line wont be able
to recieve the whole compiling argument: E.G: cmd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe C:\Downloads\December\XXX\XXXXX\BLABLA\<mooege>\build\slnfile.
That will fail because there are just too many characters, so I dont know a way to fix this.

2.Check if mooege process is running and terminate it if we are trying to do an operation that 3.compromise files being used by mooege.
4.Check for Mooege Process.
5.Implement a way to know if assembly System.Data.SQLite is running.
6.Implement !autoupdate <timer> command in order to call !update every "X" time given by the user.
7.Fix compatibility with other versios of Windows, or even go Linux too?.
