1.When compiling, MadCow needs to be in a short path folder, otherwise command line wont be able
to recieve the whole compiling argument: E.G: cmd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe C:\Downloads\December\XXX\XXXXX\BLABLA\<mooege>\build\slnfile.
That will fail because there are just too many characters, so I dont know a way to fix this.

//2.Check if mooege process is running and terminate it if we are trying to do an operation that compromise files being used by mooege.//
//3.Check for Mooege Process.//
4.Implement a way to know if assembly System.Data.SQLite is running.
//5.Implement !autoupdate <timer> command in order to call !update every "X" time given by the user.//
6.Fix compatibility with other versios of Windows, or even go Linux too?.


do we still need diablo3.cs?
do we need AutoUpdate in Commands.cs?
fristrunconfiguration in PreRequeriments.cs?
TODO: Mooege updating, when it finds a new update, does it delete old folders? (Wetwlly:I've added findandkillprocess to kill mooege if its found running.)
Kill diablo3 and Agent.exe?

7.running validater in new thread
8.move Validate Diablo Version to Form1 area
9.Validate MD5 of MPQ when Updating MPQs and (also when you find Diablo3?)

 if madcow sees coretoc error. messageBox Yes or No, do you want to try and fix error? click yes, kill diablo and mooege process, download mpq to mooege(because it doesnt matter the md5 of diablos, just mooege)
